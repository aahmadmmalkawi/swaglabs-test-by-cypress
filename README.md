# swaglabs-test-by-cypress
This is a simple experimental project using Cypress for end-to-end testing.

The tests are organized into several spec files (test suites) as follows:

- `login-logout.cy.js` — tests for login and logout functionality  
- `Inventory-Page.cy.js` — tests for inventory page interactions  
- `cart.cy.js` — tests for shopping cart operations  
- `checkout.cy.js` — tests for the checkout process  

This project serves as a practice for Cypress testing.
